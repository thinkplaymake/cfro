            <p>Asking someone &quot;why did you choose to become self-employed?&quot; presumes that it was a choice.<br><br><a href="https://leapers.co/research">Our research</a> data shows a non-insignificant proportion of freelancers found that self-employment was their only option, perhaps not being able to find a job which works around other requirements, or simply the only way to generate income.<br><br>This was especially true during COVID, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221024-the-women-forced-to-choose-self-employment">this data from the US</a> reflects that as an increasing proportion of people, especially for parents, and mothers moreso. A lack of affordable childcare, a lack of flexibility, a lack of roles which appreciate the challenges of parenting.<br><br>It&#39;s not just parenting which is the driver here - those with access issues, mental health conditions, ongoing physical health issues, carers, individuals with low-income, the list of reasons why many cannot find work which works, and people find themselves in contingent or precarious employment.<br><br>Many flourish in this way of working, many discover the benefits of self-employment - but many struggle in a situation which was not of their choosing or design, which can be hugely isolating and challenging without good preparation and support.<br><br>That&#39;s why we need to be supportive of all people working in all ways, rather than &quot;but you&#39;re self-employed, you chose not to be in employment, so all accountability should fall to you&quot; attitudes.<br><br>Not everyone has the privilege of being able to determine how they work.</p>
