            <strong>Isolation and Freelancers</strong><br/>
            The role we can play in tackling loneliness and why it creates better work.
        </h1>
        <div class="inner content">
            <p>Loneliness is <a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/the-facts-on-loneliness/">an epidemic in the UK</a> - and effects 25 million people across our country. It not only shortens life-spans but also reduces productivity, creativity and motivation. The shift in recent years to remote working and the effects of COVID have had a dramatic knock on effect to people feeling isolated - and a group of people that isolation can affect dramatically is the self-employed.</p><p>Indeed, it&#39;s a common assumption that freelancers will struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our <a href="https://www.leapers.co/resources/guide-to/dealing-with-loneliness-when-freelancing">research shows that</a> over 70% have felt affected by isolation and loneliness when self-employed.</p><p>Often for those new to freelancing, the sudden shift to having a team around them, to shouldering the responsibility for everything - doing the work, accounting, new biz, marketing, admin, development, legals - can be a shock to the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Even established freelancers can feel disconnected and very much on their own - and the move to more organisations means often freelancers are not spending time in their clients offices as much.</p><p>The answer for those individuals is to build support networks - taking the time to join communities, create connections, and building their own team. Projects like <a href="https://leapers.co">Leapers</a> exist to support freelancers creating support networks - and there are many communities who offer connection and support for independent workers across different sectors and categories.</p><p>As a client, you&#39;re also part of this team, and can also play a valuable role in supporting the freelancer in tackling isolation.</p><p>Clients can open their doors to their workspaces (I&#39;ve had a number of clients recently welcome me into their space - even though we&#39;re not working together currently).&nbsp;</p><p>Clients can create horizontal connections between their freelancers.&nbsp;</p><p>Clients can check-in and catch-up with their freelance alumni to see how things are going, or share updates on what impact a project they worked on together had.</p><p>Playing a support role provides multiple benefits for you as a client.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, the positive mental health of your independents directly relates to their productivity, quality of work, and ability to work.</p><p>Secondly, it creates a positive relationship between you and your extended workforce - freelancers are more likely to work again with clients who have supported them, and when building a network of trusted collaborators who you can work with again and again, this is essential.</p><p>Finally - it builds your reputation as a Freelance Friendly organisation, furthering your ability to attract and work with new independents who build your capabilities over time.</p><p>As a client - you play an important part in the support system of your freelancers, and working together effectively is an important part of your talent strategy as an organisation.</p>
