building support and community for those people.</p><p>&quot;A model that doesn&#39;t whitelabel freelancers, allows brands to have a team curated specifically for them, and access global big brand thinking at their fingertips - it seemed like common sense!&quot;</p><p>Built upon the insight that increasing numbers of brilliantly talented individuals are stepping out of traditional working models, or hybrid working alongside their day-jobs, exploring additional projects to complement their passions and interests, and
being able to tap into that independent workforce provides a powerful offering for clients.</p><p>&quot;If we don&#39;t have exceptional freelancers coming to us, we don&#39;t have a business full stop&quot;</p><p>Tash and I spoke about why being freelance first benefits both the freelancers and the clients, what it takes to create a supportive community, and the challenges of being a company founder.</p><p>You can listen to the full episode above, or learn more about Mash at <a href="https://thisismash.com/"></a><a href="https://thisismash.com/">https://thisismash.com/</a></p><p><br></p><h1>Six things we learned from Mash</h1><p>1/ You can create a full service offering, with a small core team but accessing a wider pool of independent talent, leveraging freelancers and consultants to build your offering - with a &quot;no walls&quot; mindset.</p><p><br></p><p>2/ Agency employee churn can be 50% or higher, an engaged freelancer community like Mash has 3% churn - putting paid to the myth that freelancers don&#39;t stick around.</p><p><br></p><p>3/ Building an engaged freelancer community is more than just keeping a little black book of names and email addresses. Mash&#39;s two-sided thinking of &quot;transactions&quot; and &quot;engagement&quot;, is a really smart way of ensuring both process
and connection is delivered well.</p><p><br></p><p>4/ Working independently can come with gaps, working alone, lack of collaboration, lack of training and support - being part of a collective or community can add some of that connection back, and collectives who offer this are adding value to the freelancer
experience. Being part of a collective can also help freelancers focus on their craft skills, rather than the rest of the offering, i.e. accounting, marketing, sales, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>5/ Don&#39;t whitelabel your freelancers - embrace the fluid talent you&#39;re building your teams from, it&#39;s one of the reasons freelancers will return to work with you again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>6/ Working with freelancers enables you to create a global workforce, tapping into local cultural insight and understanding.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to more conversations with Freelance Friendly businesses on Spotify, or have a chat with us to find out how you can be Freelance Friendly, and work well with independents.</p><p><br></p>
