            <strong>The unbundling of work</strong><br/>
            From centralised nodes to networked relationships.
        </h1>
        <div class="inner content">
            <p>Are we seeing the final unbundling of work?</p><p>Whilst the long tail of interconnected businesses who work together to bring us goods and services is not a new concept - each link in that chain, each supplier or provider, was in most ways encapsulated - the farmer owns the land and cattle, the mill owned the equipment and employees, the agency buys the laptops and hires the staff. Each unit would be a self-contained creator of something.</p><p>But we&#39;re increasingly seeing a shift further away from centralised ownership to decentralised coordination, reflected more and more in not just the progressive businesses, but also in the mainstream.</p><p><br></p><p>Employees are no longer tethered to a physical workplace.</p><p>People are no longer exclusive to a single employer.</p><p>Working hours are no longer fixed to the 9-5/M-F.</p><p>Employers are no longer restricted by a finite talent pool or obligation to provide work.</p><p>Workspaces no longer have a single occupant.</p><p>Teams no longer need to have a consistent shape over time.</p><p>Clients no longer need to be tied in to exclusive partners, or a single relationship to source their specialists.</p><p><br></p><p>The bundle of employer, employees, space, capabilities and relationships have shattered apart - and a new range of operating models, systems, platforms, opportunities and challenges have rushed in to fill the gaps.</p><p>And we&#39;re all feeling the growing pains - or at the very least, questioning how to adjust and redesign for what unbundled work looks like.</p><p><br></p><p>For freelancers, it feels like a huge new opportunity - a new openness to discovering and working with people who aren&#39;t already part of the team, means more businesses are investing in finding ways to build new extended workforces.</p><p>For businesses, it feels like a huge challenge, and without an active design process to pause and ask: &quot;What does the new shape of our workforce look like, and how do we work best with them?&quot;, the old models will be applied to the new models, and most likely fail - or at best, be harder work for poorer outcomes.</p><p>The unbundling of work means that where the cohesion and strength sits moves away from the elements in the supply chain, the entities, the organisations, the agencies, the employers - towards the connections, the networks. We need thicker, smarter, stronger well designed relationships, not just strong nodes.</p><p>We&#39;ll increasingly see services which offer these connections between nodes in the network - coworking spaces are places to assemble, talent platforms are ways to grow networks, communities are ways to strengthen those networks, and the emerging roles of people who help develop a strategy for designing and leveraging these networks - the space which I&#39;m inhabiting.</p><p>These networks take time to build, grow, develop and activate. You can&#39;t turn it on overnight. It requires proactive investment and nurturing. The businesses who saw this happening three years ago, are having successes now.&nbsp;</p><p>The unbundling is happening, whether you&#39;re engaged with it or not - and the organisations who don&#39;t take stock of what it means for their ways of working and total workforce, will find themselves even less able function in the next three years.</p>
