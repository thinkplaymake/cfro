        "subtitle": "Key reasons and steps to invest in working better with freelancers",
        "content": "<p><strong>With January being the month</strong> where employees are most likely to think about leaving their job, 2020 set to be another year with huge growth in the number of people turning to self-employment and freelancing as their primary source of income, and according to research: <strong>64% of firms rely upon freelancers as part of their workforce</strong> - there&rsquo;s no better time for businesses to start thinking seriously about how they better engage with, and work effectively with their freelance workforce.</p><p>___</p><p><strong>If it had escaped your attention</strong>, freelancers are not your employees - so have not been given the induction to why your business exists, have not had the time to understand the internal culture and ways of working you have, don&rsquo;t have the luxury of months to build trust and relationships with the team. They&rsquo;re often in your business for a short period of time, with a focused task at hand - and this requires a different approach to working.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately - many businesses are not actively considering how to work with freelancers in the most effective and supportive way, with freelancers often being &lsquo;bolted on&rsquo; to teams and expected to get hit the ground running. Why does this matter? There are three main reasons you might want to think about this.</p><blockquote>&quot;Working with freelancers effectively requires a different approach to working together well&quot;</blockquote><p><strong>Financial</strong> - if you&rsquo;re not effectively engaging with your suppliers and workforce, you&rsquo;re losing money. Stories of freelancers waiting around in reception to be collected, not being able to connect to the internal systems, not being briefed adequately, time spent on setting up contracts and payments, anything which gets in the way of being productive leads to you losing money. Designing better ways to engage with an ad-hoc workforce will not only save you money, but create better profitability, unlocking access more diverse and more experienced talent for your growth.</p><p><strong>Quality</strong> - if you&rsquo;re not designing your workforce to work together well, if you&rsquo;re not creating high performing teams, if you&rsquo;re not considering how relationships are created over time and giving your people the best chance of creating the best work, the quality of your work suffers. Most people just want to do their best work, but we hold them back by not designing work better.</p><p><strong>People</strong> - the 5m+ people who are self-employed have little or no workplace support when it comes to mental health. You&rsquo;ve invested in the wellbeing of your employees, because you understand the human cost and business cost, but if you&rsquo;re ignoring a sizeable proportion of your workforce - you&rsquo;ll not be able to access that talent in the future. If you believe the future of work is more flexible and agile, and you want to continue to be able to use a diverse workforce on demand, you need to invest in its wellbeing.</p><p>___</p><p><strong>Based upon the work we&rsquo;ve done with freelancers and businesses who hire freelancers</strong>, there are 8 essential things to consider to design a more effective experience for both your business and the individual:</p><h2>1. Create Accountability</h2><p>There generally isn&rsquo;t any single individual who takes responsibility for understanding the freelance experience, so things fall between the gaps. Give someone responsibility for asking questions, checking for issues, and addressing the problems. You&rsquo;ll save money, time and headaches by understanding where you&rsquo;re ineffective.</p><h2>2. Trusted Networks</h2><p>Shift the mindset from &lsquo;on-demand resource&rsquo; to building &rsquo;trusted networks of talent&rsquo;, which you can augment your workforce with, not just based upon capabilities, but how they work with you. Trusted talent networks reduce time to hire, cost to hire, risk and improve quality and profitability.</p><h2>3. Onboarding</h2><p>Look at how you&rsquo;re welcoming external talent to your business, to ensure they&rsquo;re off to a good start, and you&rsquo;re not neglecting any emotional, legal, health and safety duties when you&rsquo;re working with others. It&rsquo;s easy, can often be automated, and helps you create your alumni.</p><h2>4. Team Building</h2><p>Rethink how you design teams based upon integrating internal and external talent, or how you cast a team based upon differing work styles, mindsets, capabilities and experience - not just job titles. Your team doesn&rsquo;t have three months to &lsquo;bed in&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. In-Project Effectiveness</h2><p>Look at what the structures you need in place to ensure everyone is being supported, your project is running effectively, and how you resolve issues. Understand how you are defining and measuring performance, and start to reflect the value of external talent in your business metrics, rather than seeing it only as a &lsquo;cost&rsquo;.</p><h2>6. Process and Payments</h2><p>Fix the basics, get people paid on time and quickly, create contracts better suited to freelance engagement, understand and consider IR35 with nuance rather than making blanket decisions, and get people paid on time and quickly. Pay people on time, and pay people on time. You&rsquo;ll be saving on late payment fees, reducing impact on your accounts team, and you&rsquo;ll not get blacklisted by your talent.</p><h2>7. Post Project Feedback</h2><p>Create feedback loops to better understand your process, but also provide feedback to those you&rsquo;ve worked with. It&rsquo;s an essential part of being motivated about the work you&rsquo;re doing, but also creates a way of building positive relationships with your talent.</p><h2>8. Investment in Alumni</h2><p>Looping back to your trusted networks, create an alumni who you can call upon, invest in their training, development and support whilst you&rsquo;re not working with them, and make sure you&rsquo;re creating a workforce you can continue to call upon.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t try and do all this at once</strong>, but if there&rsquo;s one thing you can do, <strong>start with accountability</strong>, and make sure someone is asking how effectively are you engaging with your growing external workforce.&nbsp;</p>",

They need to be, as often they have to navigate a new client organisation at the start of every project, and often they don&#39;t get any useful onboarding. Just imagine how much wasted time spent on figuring things out, rather than having a useful guide to help them.</p><p>Onboarding might seem like something you only do for your employees, but sharing some critical information about your company, your values, the work you do, how you work, who you work with, and the super important &nbsp;things that you freelancers really need to know like points of contact, useful resources, frequently asked questions, and even things like where the best lunch places are locally, all really help. Not just to work more effectively, but also to create a better relationship with your freelancers - and we know that freelancers who feel better supported are more likely to be open to working with you again.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to host an on-boarding session - you can automate the process to share information, you can provide it as a standard pack for every freelancer, and just make sure it&#39;s up to date every few months. And I&#39;ve created a template to help you get started, which lists the key sections we recommend to include, based upon insights from our community of thousands of freelancers.</p><p>If you&#39;re subscribed, the link to the onboarding template is below - if you&#39;re not already a follower, leave us your email address and we&#39;ll send you the template to get started.</p><p>If you&#39;d like more help on helping your business to work better together with freelancers, let me know - from free audits to building bespoke communities of freelancers, we are here to help.</p>",

It&rsquo;s a big reason why we exist as a project, to be one of the sources of support, as well as signpost to other valid and good quality support mechanisms, but we can only be effective in doing that if people know about us.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"c9f0\">That&rsquo;s why <strong>signposting</strong> for employers is so critical and important as the first step in supporting your total workforce.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"2008\">S<strong>ignposting</strong> is the simple act of helping people be more aware of where they can find support.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"4fae\">It&rsquo;s a step before providing that support yourself, and often is adopted more readily than your own support &mdash; as you&rsquo;re letting people know a range of places where they can seek impartial and independent help.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"53bc\">This is <em>especially important for the self-employed</em> as they may not want to let their client know they&rsquo;re struggling emotionally, as often the freelancer might feel it could create concern the project will not be completed, only adding to further stress (even if their client might be wonderfully supportive, the anxiety of sharing can be worse than reality), and a majority of freelancers say they would not share with their client if they were feeling stressed or suffering with poor mental health.</p><h3 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d00b\">How does signposting work?</h3><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"7534\">At its simplest, it&rsquo;s about providing a list of useful and authoritative sources for support &mdash; places your people can turn to, in order to find out more, to connect with someone, to reach out and get what they need.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"c903\">Those sources and materials need to be of <em>good quality, rooted in evidence, from authoritative and respected providers</em>, and be written in a understanding and supportive way &mdash; that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe these ten ways to improve your mental health&rdquo; listicles, but content that can be trusted.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"a735\">Secondly, those resources <em>need to be relevant to the self-employed experience&nbsp;</em>&mdash; content which suggests &ldquo;make sure you use your paid sick leave to rest&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t going to help a freelancer, nor is &ldquo;speak to your line manager or HR team&rdquo;. Whilst 80% of mental health resources are relevant to 80% of people, helping them find content which tackles the unique issues they might be facing is essential.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"b507\">Thirdly, it&rsquo;s not just about content, but also community and support services which they can turn to in times of need. That could be counselling or therapy services, it could be local healthcare services, it could be peer-support and community networks. It&rsquo;s not enough to just offer reading material, but aim for offering genuine connection.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"18bb\">Signposting will often simply be a list, helping the individual to navigate the links and resources which could help &mdash; that list could be a downloadble PDF, it might be a page on your intranet, it could be a poster in the breakout room, some employers offer phone numbers or support email addresses to ask questions, or even chatbots to intelligently automate the process.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d55e\">But critically &mdash; it must be <em>visible and easily accessible</em> to the individual.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"239d\">This means you need to both create the signposting resources and ensure it&rsquo;s communicated to everyone you work with. <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/winter2019/pages/companies-seek-to-boost-low-usage-of-employee-assistance-programs.aspx\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Recent research shows</a> that whilst over 97% of large companies offer support platforms like an EAP, only 6% of people are using them, and over 50% of employees don&rsquo;t know they exist or think there isn&rsquo;t one &mdash; pointing to the importance of communications in any sort of signposting and support.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"4014\">For the self-employed, t<em>his communication is even harder</em>: there is rarely a formal onboarding process or documentation the individual receives at the start of a project and more often than not, they&rsquo;re not part of an EAP; and more important: as they don&rsquo;t have the time or space to find it themselves.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d361\">I&rsquo;ve worked with businesses who offered their freelancers access to amazing levels of support, but none of their freelancers (or people who were bringing those freelancers in) knew it was available, making the investment and effort a waste of time.</p><h3 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"a050\">So what to do?</h3><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"45f6\"><a href=\"https://leapers.co/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Leapers</strong></a> is committed to tackling this issue by offering a free signposting service for any organisation who hires freelancers. We&rsquo;re doing this because we don&rsquo;t believe there should be no excuses in not signposting, but also recognise the time and effort it takes to create these resources can fall beyond priorities and responsibilities. So we&rsquo;ll do the hard work!</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"bc27\"><strong>STEP 1 &mdash; SIGNPOSTING</strong><br>We&rsquo;ve built a customisable landing page, which you can send your freelancers to when they arrive in your business, and we take care of making sure the links, resources and content are up to date and relevant for your people. It&rsquo;s entirely free to use, <a href=\"https://www.leapers.co/freelance-friendly/home#signpost\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">just let us know</a> and we&rsquo;ll create your own page which you can send to your freelancers.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"cbab\"><strong>STEP 2 &mdash; COMMUNICATING</strong><br>We&rsquo;re building a tool to help with the communication challenge too, it&rsquo;s as simple as inviting your freelancer (just their email address and bing, you&rsquo;re done!), and we&rsquo;ll handle the rest. They&rsquo;ll get signposted to support, invited to a peer-community, and join your freelance alumni &mdash; all in a single go. We&rsquo;re inviting organisations who are interested in trying this out to <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrxp3E4cLY175ecd\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">drop us a note</a>, and we&rsquo;ll get you involved in the beta tests.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"2287\">There are plenty more things which you can do, of course, to support your freelancers&rsquo; mental health, all of which not only support the individual, but also lead to more motivated, more engaged, more creative and and better quality work from your freelancers &mdash; it even leads to freelancers prioritising those clients who support them over those who don&rsquo;t &mdash; but to start with, if you&rsquo;re not already signposting,<em>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the least you can do.</em></p>",

It not only shortens life-spans but also reduces productivity, creativity and motivation. The shift in recent years to remote working and the effects of COVID have had a dramatic knock on effect to people feeling isolated - and a group of people that isolation can affect dramatically is the self-employed.</p><p>Indeed, it&#39;s a common assumption that freelancers will struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our <a href=\"https://www.leapers.co/resources/guide-to/dealing-with-loneliness-when-freelancing\">research shows that</a> over 70% have felt affected by isolation and loneliness when self-employed.</p><p>Often for those new to freelancing, the sudden shift to having a team around them, to shouldering the responsibility for everything - doing the work, accounting, new biz, marketing, admin, development, legals - can be a shock to the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Even established freelancers can feel disconnected and very much on their own - and the move to more organisations means often freelancers are not spending time in their clients offices as much.</p><p>The answer for those individuals is to build support networks - taking the time to join communities, create connections, and building their own team. Projects like <a href=\"https://leapers.co\">Leapers</a> exist to support freelancers creating support networks - and there are many communities who offer connection and support for independent workers across different sectors and categories.</p><p>As a client, you&#39;re also part of this team, and can also play a valuable role in supporting the freelancer in tackling isolation.</p><p>Clients can open their doors to their workspaces (I&#39;ve had a number of clients recently welcome me into their space - even though we&#39;re not working together currently).&nbsp;</p><p>Clients can create horizontal connections between their freelancers.&nbsp;</p><p>Clients can check-in and catch-up with their freelance alumni to see how things are going, or share updates on what impact a project they worked on together had.</p><p>Playing a support role provides multiple benefits for you as a client.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, the positive mental health of your independents directly relates to their productivity, quality of work, and ability to work.</p><p>Secondly, it creates a positive relationship between you and your extended workforce - freelancers are more likely to work again with clients who have supported them, and when building a network of trusted collaborators who you can work with again and again, this is essential.</p><p>Finally - it builds your reputation as a Freelance Friendly organisation, furthering your ability to attract and work with new independents who build your capabilities over time.</p><p>As a client - you play an important part in the support system of your freelancers, and working together effectively is an important part of your talent strategy as an organisation.</p>",
